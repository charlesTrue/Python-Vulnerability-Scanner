Steps 1: Launching the GUI
GUI Components:
1. Target(s) Entry: A text field where you input the IP addresses or hostnames you want to scan. You can enter single or multiple targets separated by spaces.
2. Custom Nmap Command Entry:A text field for entering a custom Nmap command. Here, you can specify any Nmap flags or commands you want to use instead of the default set in the script.
3. Scan Interval Entries: Three separate fields for specifying the interval at which repeated scans should occur:
   - Minutes:How many minutes to wait between scans.
   - Hours: How many hours to wait between scans.
   - Days: How many days to wait between scans.
4. Start Scan Button: Initiates the scanning process based on the inputs.
5. Stop Scan Button: Stops any ongoing repeated scans.
6. Scan Output File Entry: Displays the filename where the scan results are saved. This is updated after each scan.
